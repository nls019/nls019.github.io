# Quest 9: The Dance of Shadows and Light

## Objectives
Welcome, Adept!

Having tamed the forces of light and texture, it is time to explore their interplay with the physical world. In this quest, you shall harness the power of shadows, reflections, and refractions to bring greater realism to your scenes. The knowledge gained here will allow you to create the illusion of depth, transparency, and mirror-like surfaces.

By the end of this journey, you will wield the power to:

- Implement hard shadows using shadow rays.
- Render soft shadows through area light sampling and filtering techniques.
- Simulate perfect reflections for mirror-like surfaces.
- Bend light realistically through refraction and transparency.
- Create soft shadows for transparent objects to enhance realism.

## Quest Overview
This quest focuses on shadows, reflection, and refraction in ray tracing:

1. Casting Shadows: Implement techniques for hard and soft shadows.
2. Reflecting Reality: Simulate mirror-like reflections.
3. Refracting Light: Model transparent materials and light bending.

**Note**: This quest builds upon the previous quests. Ensure you have completed Quest 8 before proceeding.

## Feature Points
Earn feature point listed below is worth **1 point**(except SDFs). The total possible points for this quest are **10+** for the entire quest. You only need 60 points from 10 quests. Do as many as you want. On average, you should get 6 points per quest.

### Shadows
- **1 point**: Implement and demonstrate hard shadows (shadow ray test)
- **1 point**: Implement and demonstrate soft shadows using area light sampling
- **1 point**: Implement and demonstrate soft shadows using Percentage-Closer Filtering (PCF)
- **1 point**: Implement and demonstrate soft shadows using distance-based techniques
- **2 points**: Implement and demonstrate Signed Distance Field (SDF) soft shadows.

### Reflection
- **1 point**: Implement and demonstrate perfect mirror reflection
- **1 point**: Implement and demonstrate reflections with multiple bounces (iterative ray tracing)

### Refraction
- **1 point**: Implement and demonstrate basic refraction using Snell's Law
- **1 point**: Implement and demonstrate refractions with multiple bounces (iterative ray tracing)
- **1 point**: Implement and demonstrate soft shadows for transparent objects

### Special Effects
- **1 point**: Create a scene featuring both reflections and refractions (e.g., a glass sphere on a reflective surface).
- **1 point**: (Repeatable, 1 point each) Implement and demonstrate an advanced shadowing technique beyond those described (e.g., stochastic shadow mapping, caustics, volumetric shadows)

### Others
- **1 point**: Win the weekly quest contest. On Monday, in class, you will vote for the best craft of the week. **If you win, you earn an extra point!**
- **? points**: Anything that impresses me (e.g. rendering water drops). **Write them clearly in your description to convince me they are impressive!**

### Submission Instructions
- Fork this quest repository to begin your quest and ensure you commit your code there before the due date.
- Ensure your Arcane Portal is public and contains all relevant and **obfuscated** code. I recommend you update the Arcane Portal every time you complete a quest.
- Your Arcane Portal site should display the visual effect(s) and include any required descriptions.
