# The Legendary Blockasaurus

After quite a few attempts inside, I decided the act of summoning a beast this grand should *probably* take place outside. 
After all, it would probably like some room to run around.

I allocated *all* of my focus to the next cast, and within mere seconds the graceful Blockasaurus appeared within my view. I couldn't believe my eyes!
Though I'm just starting out, this is a great step towards becoming a master summoner.

Now, what else should I try to bring into our world...?

### Impressive Features

1. Only the shaders that are necessary for each shape are loaded in dynamically (I know there are better ways than using multiple shaders, but I still figured this out without delving into next week's material).
2. I added a unique icon and name for the image. It isn't much, but I thought it was neat.
3. I tried to do semi-realistic shading for the background objects versus the foreground ones. The right legs/claws and back plates are both slightly darker to better distinguish where they are relative to the body.
